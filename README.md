# Named Entity Relation Extractino from personal letters

The aim of our research is to create a dataset with annotated relations between named entities in a data-specific domain of diary texts, leveraging the existing "Razmecheno" dataset for NER (Atnashev et al., 2022) and using crowdsourcing, and evaluate different models for relation extraction in the context of a high paucity of labelled data. The objectives of the research are the following. First of all, we will train a model for named entity recognition in order to annotate more raw data from “Prozhito” than is represented in the “Razmecheno” dataset. Secondly, we will design and write a script for a new user-friendly interface for crowdsourced annotation of relations on “Yandex.Toloka” and, using it, add a relation markup layer to the dataset. Then, we will analyse various methods for addressing the issue of sparse human annotation and explore state-of-the-art models for relation extraction. Finally, we will fine-tune existing relation extraction models on our dataset.
